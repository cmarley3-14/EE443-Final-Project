### Directory:

* [Marley_Christopher_FinalProject.zip](Marley_Christopher_FinalProject.zip) contains the .pdf report, the .ipynb code, and the .txt test results.
  - These files are available outside of the zip folder as well, and are suffixed in the same way as above.
* [img_labeling.py](img_labeling.py) is the code I used to label the test images. It is simple and likely breakable if not used properly.
* [labels.txt](labels.txt) contains the labels I manually assigned to the images in the test folder.
